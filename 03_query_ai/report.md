# FDA Medical Device Recall Report (2024)

## Executive Summary
In 2024, a total of 1,000 medical device recalls were initiated, reflecting varying challenges in the industry. The analysis indicates that while certain root causes led to high recall rates, significant fluctuations were observed in monthly recall volumes.

## Key Findings
- The most prominent cause of recalls was “Under Investigation by firm,” accounting for 27% (270 recalls) of all incidents.
- The month of September saw the highest number of recalls, with 271 devices recalled, representing 27.1% of the total for the year.
- Device design issues contributed to a substantial 9.7% (97 recalls) of overall recalls, highlighting design as a critical area for improvement.
- Monthly recall counts were notably low in February and May, with only a single recall each month, suggesting potential gaps in monitoring or reporting.

## Root Cause Analysis
The dominant root cause of “Under Investigation by firm” suggests a significant reliance on manufacturer self-reporting and internal investigations which may be indicative of deeper issues in quality control processes. Additionally, root causes related to design and process control account for over 40% of recalls, indicating that further scrutiny in these areas is warranted to prevent future occurrences.

## Monthly Trends
Throughout 2024, recall volumes displayed considerable variability, with significant spikes noted in the latter half of the year, particularly in September (271 recalls) and October (239 recalls). This trend suggests heightened surveillance or perhaps increased market pressures leading to urgent recalls during these months.

## Recommendations
- Device manufacturers should enhance internal quality assurance systems to proactively identify and address potential issues, particularly in design and process control.
- Regulators should consider increased oversight and support for firms facing a high number of recalls, especially those under investigation, to ensure compliance with safety protocols.
- Implement periodic training for product design and process management teams to mitigate risks associated with high recurrence of design and control-related recalls.
